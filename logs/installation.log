 ----------------- for csh/tcsh users -----------------------------

 You should now add the following to your .cshrc file:

 setenv ARCHDEFS /home/qyx/cutest/archdefs
 setenv SIFDECODE /home/qyx/cutest/sifdecode
 setenv CUTEST /home/qyx/cutest/cutest
 set path=(${SIFDECODE}/bin $path)
 set path=(${CUTEST}/bin $path)
 setenv MANPATH ${SIFDECODE}/man:${MANPATH}
 setenv MANPATH ${CUTEST}/man:${MANPATH}

 Optionally, if you also wish this to be your default version, set

 setenv MYARCH pc.lnx.gfo

 Finally, remember to setenv MASTSIF to your SIF test-problem directory

 ----------------- for sh/bash users -----------------------------

 You should now add the following to your .bashrc file:

 export ARCHDEFS="/home/qyx/cutest/archdefs"
 export SIFDECODE="/home/qyx/cutest/sifdecode"
 export CUTEST="/home/qyx/cutest/cutest"
 export PATH="${SIFDECODE}/bin:${PATH}"
 export PATH="${CUTEST}/bin:${PATH}"
 export MANPATH="${SIFDECODE}/man:${MANPATH}"
 export MANPATH="${CUTEST}/man:${MANPATH}"

 Optionally, if you also wish this to be your default version, add

 export MYARCH="pc.lnx.gfo"

 Finally, remember to export MASTSIF="" to your SIF test-problem directory
